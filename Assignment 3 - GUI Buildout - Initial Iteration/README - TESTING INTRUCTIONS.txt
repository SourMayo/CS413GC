INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING:

-- --

In case there are any issues, the jar files are found in the "Files" directory in the repo.

To create my tables, I followed the mySQL pdf's provided by professor.
I used the given bankaccount.csv and CustomerData.csv for my databases.
I did not incorporate Sex and Birthday.
These files can also be found in the "Resources" folder found in "src." 

-- --

In CustomerDataConnection.java, on line 31, change PASSWORD to your server password.

To test the GUI, run SwingDriver.java or HomePage.java.
Creating a customer, updating a customer, and viewing a customer works correctly and successfully edits the database.

The DTOAndDAODemo works with altering the information as well.
